# Welcome to LearnBlox

Welcome to **LearnBlox**! 🎉 We're excited to have you here.

LearnBlox is an online platform designed to help students like you learn computer science in a fun and interactive way. It’s perfect for schools and classrooms.

## 💡 What is LearnBlox?

LearnBlox gives schools the tools they need to teach coding:
- 🧩 A **playground** to build programs with blocks.
- 📚 **Learning courses & modules** like this one to explore new ideas.
- 💼 **Projects** assigned by your teacher to test your knowledge.
- 👩‍🏫 Teachers can create lessons and check your progress.

## 🧠 Why Block-Based Coding?

When you're just starting out, writing code with real words and symbols can be confusing. That's why we use **block-based coding**, powered by **Blockly** (an open-source tool from Google). It lets you **drag and drop** blocks to build logic without needing to worry about spelling or punctuation.

Once you feel confident, you'll be able to **switch to Python**—a real programming language used by professionals!
