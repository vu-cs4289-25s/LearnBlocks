# Coding Basics: Conditionals and Loops

Welcome to your first coding activity! Today, you'll learn how to make your programs **smarter** using _conditionals_ and _loops_.

## 🔍 What’s a Conditional?

A **conditional** lets your program make decisions. It's like saying:
> "If it's raining, then bring an umbrella."

### Try It:
1. Go to the **Logic** tab in the Playground.
2. Drag in the `if ... do` block.
3. Attach a `true` block inside the condition space.

👧🏽 _Think of the `true` block as saying, “This condition is happening.”_

4. Add another block (like `print`) inside the `do` section.
5. Hit **Run** and see what happens!

## 🔁 What’s a Loop?

A **loop** repeats instructions again and again—until something changes.

> "While I’m hungry, keep eating 🍽️"

### Try It:
1. Go to the **Loops** tab.
2. Drag the `while` block into the workspace.
3. Place a `true` block in the condition space.
4. Put a block inside the loop that prints or moves something.
5. Try **Switch to Python** and see what the real code looks like!

When you’re ready, hit **Run Code** to test what you’ve made.

🎯 **Submit this code** when it works the way you want.
