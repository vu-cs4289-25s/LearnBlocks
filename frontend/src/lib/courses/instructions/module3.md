# Joining and Navigating Classes

LearnBlox helps organize students and teachers into **classrooms**, just like at school!

## 🏫 How Do I Join a Class?

Your teacher will give you a **Join Code**. Think of it like a secret password that lets you into the right class.

### To Join a Class:
1. Click **Join Class** from your home page.
2. Enter your **Class code**.
3. Click **Join**, and you’re in!

Now, you can see:
- 📜 Your lessons and projects.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Your classmates.
- 🧑‍🏫 Your teacher’s name.
